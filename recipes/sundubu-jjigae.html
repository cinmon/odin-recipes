    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sundubu jjigae, or spicy soft tofu stew, starts by heating a clay pot or regular pot over medium heat with a bit 
        of vegetable oil. Add minced garlic, sliced onions, and gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) to the pot, 
        stirring until fragrant and the oil turns red. For added flavor, you can also include some kimchi or small 
        pieces of pork, beef, or seafood at this stage, cooking until the meat is done.</p>

    <p>Next, pour in a cup of anchovy or beef broth and bring it to a boil. Add in sliced zucchini, mushrooms, and other 
        vegetables you like, allowing them to cook until tender. Then, gently add a tube of sundubu (extra soft tofu) by 
        breaking it into large chunks, and let it simmer for a few minutes. Season with a bit of soy sauce and salt to 
        taste. To finish, crack an egg into the boiling stew and garnish with chopped green onions and a dash of sesame 
        oil. Serve sundubu jjigae piping hot, often with steamed rice and kimchi on the side.</p>
