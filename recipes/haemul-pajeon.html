    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Haemul pajeon, a Korean seafood and green onion pancake, begins by preparing the batter. In a large bowl, 
        mix equal parts of flour and water, adding a bit of salt and an egg to create a smooth, pourable consistency. 
        For extra crispiness, you can also add a bit of rice flour or cornstarch to the mixture.</p>

    <p>Next, heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Arrange a layer of green 
        onions (cut into 2-3 inch pieces) in the pan, then pour a ladleful of the batter evenly over the green onions. 
        Scatter an assortment of seafood, such as shrimp, squid, and clams, over the batter. Press the seafood gently 
        into the batter to ensure it adheres well. Cook the pancake until the bottom is golden brown and crispy, then 
        carefully flip it over and cook the other side. Once both sides are crispy and the seafood is cooked through, 
        remove the pancake from the pan and cut it into pieces. Serve haemul pajeon hot with a dipping sauce made of soy 
        sauce, vinegar, and a bit of sugar or sesame oil.</p>
