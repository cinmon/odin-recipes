    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sogogi gukbap, a hearty Korean beef and rice soup, is made by first preparing the beef broth. Start by boiling a piece 
        of beef brisket or shank in a pot of water with a few garlic cloves and a chunk of ginger. Let it simmer for 
        about an hour until the beef becomes tender and the broth is rich in flavor. Remove the beef from the pot, let 
        it cool slightly, and then shred it into bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <p>In the same pot, add the shredded beef back to the broth along with sliced radish and onion. Season with soy 
        sauce, salt, and a bit of pepper to taste. Let it simmer until the radish becomes tender. Prepare steamed white 
        rice separately and place a serving of rice into individual bowls. Pour the hot beef broth over the rice, 
        ensuring each bowl gets a good amount of beef and vegetables. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve sogogi 
        gukbap immediately, often with a side of kimchi and other banchan (Korean side dishes).</p>
